1.12.2

Change the top line to change which version of nginx is used by the
NNBC firewall. Scripts obtain the version via `head -1 VERSION`, so:
  1. Make sure the version is on the top line.
  2. Make sure there are no other characters on the top line, like
     spaces or tabs.
  3. You can put notes anywhere else in this file.
